# Prompt:
You are given a 0-indexed array usageLimits of length n.
Your task is to create groups using numbers from 0 to n - 1, ensuring that each number, i, is used no more than usageLimits[i] times in total across all groups. You must also satisfy the following conditions:

Each group must consist of distinct numbers, meaning that no duplicate numbers are allowed within a single group.
Each group (except the first one) must have a length strictly greater than the previous group.

Return an integer denoting the maximum number of groups you can create while satisfying these conditions.
 
Example 1:

Input: usageLimits = [1,2,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: In this example, we can use 0 at most once, 1 at most twice, and 2 at most five times.
One way of creating the maximum number of groups while satisfying the conditions is: 
Group 1 contains the number [2].
Group 2 contains the numbers [1,2].
Group 3 contains the numbers [0,1,2]. 
It can be shown that the maximum number of groups is 3. 
So, the output is 3. 
Example 2:

Input: usageLimits = [2,1,2]
Output: 2
Explanation: In this example, we can use 0 at most twice, 1 at most once, and 2 at most twice.
One way of creating the maximum number of groups while satisfying the conditions is:
Group 1 contains the number [0].
Group 2 contains the numbers [1,2].
It can be shown that the maximum number of groups is 2.
So, the output is 2. 

Example 3:

Input: usageLimits = [1,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: In this example, we can use both 0 and 1 at most once.
One way of creating the maximum number of groups while satisfying the conditions is:
Group 1 contains the number [0].
It can be shown that the maximum number of groups is 1.
So, the output is 1. 

 
Constraints:

1 <= usageLimits.length <= 10^5
1 <= usageLimits[i] <= 10^9
# Solution:
