    // In this Kata, you have to sort an array array list of non-negative integers according to
    // number of ones in their binary representation in ascending order.
    // For similar number of ones, sort based on decimal value.
    // It must be implemented like this:
    // >>> sortArray((new ArrayList<Long>(Arrays.asList((long)1l, (long)5l, (long)2l, (long)3l, (long)4l))))
    // (new ArrayList<Long>(Arrays.asList((long)1l, (long)2l, (long)3l, (long)4l, (long)5l)))
